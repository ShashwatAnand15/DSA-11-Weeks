// Binary Search :- The idea of binary search is to use the information that 
// the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n). 
// We use while loop in binary search. while(l<=r)

// Ternary Search same as binary search, we divide into 3
// Time complexity = O(log base 3 n)

// i & j are made mid + 1 & mid -1 not just mid because then i<j will never fail & it will get into an infinite loop for searching max element or value greater than max element
