// High package companies ask this topic
// Nutanix asked a derivative of MCM(matrix chain multiplication) ques
// DP = Enhanced recursion
// How to identify a dynamic programming problem?
1. Choice - whether to select an object or not -> recursion hai, 
            Then if the recursion is calling one function it is not DP, if it is calling 2 function then yes, it can be DP
2. Optimality - Max, Min, Largest etc

// DONT MAKE TABLE IN THE START ONLY(WHICH IS CALLED TOP DOWN APPROACH) :- WRONG APPROACH(COZ U WILL DEFINITELY MAKE A MISTAKE IN MAKING IT)
Steps to solve:-
Recursive -> Memoize -> Top down if u want
Just write the recursive function first.
