A circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. 
A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list. 

Advantages:
1) Used in implementation of queue
2) Operating system uses circular linked list.
3) Circular DLL are used to implement advanced DS like Fibonacci Heap.

We will use do while loop to print the loop atleast once for CLL
