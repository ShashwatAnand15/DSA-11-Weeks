// int = 10^9
// long int = 10^18
// What if u want to store 10^30, 10^25
// We can use string ="554115574125..." every place will take 1 byte memory, array would take 4 byte
// How would u do calculation on string? The string are so large we can't convert them into numbers
// s1 = "735"  s2 = "1234" s1+s2 ="1969"
// We can reverse the string, as adition happens from ones digit.
