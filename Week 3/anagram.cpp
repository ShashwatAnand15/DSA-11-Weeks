// An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. 
// For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

// Method 1: By sorting both the strings (Sorting will take nlogn, comparing will take n, hence total TC = O nlogn)
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


// Method 2: Storing the frequency of each character if they are equal then anagram
