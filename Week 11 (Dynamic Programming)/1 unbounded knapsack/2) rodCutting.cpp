// Input:- Length of Rod (N)  Say N = 4  
//         Price Array [] = {3,6,8,8}, Length of pieces array may/maynot be given = {1,2,3,4} (Common Sense if there is no boundation on length in which we can split)
// Size of the rod & size of the array is same in most of the cases here t[4+1][4+1]
// To cut the rods in various parts such that to gain max profit
// Similar to unbounded knapsack becoz 4 = 2+2 or 1+1+2  i.e. repitition is allowed.
// wt -> length[], val -> price[] -> W -> N
